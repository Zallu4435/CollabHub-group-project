  - Real-time user count updates

### 4. Collaborative Sidebar

## Components Added

### 1. `CollaborativeEditor.tsx`

- Handles user awareness and connection status
- Provides Google Docs-like editing experience

### 2. `VoiceChat.tsx`

## Usage Instructions

### Enabling Collaborative Mode
1. Click the "Collaborate" button in the toolbar
2. The collaborative sidebar will appear on the right
3. Set your username and room ID in the settings dropdown
4. Start editing - changes will sync in real-time

### Using Voice Chat
1. Click "Join Voice" in the collaborative sidebar
2. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. Use mute/unmute controls as needed
4. Click "Leave" to disconnect from voice chat

### Room Management
- Each room ID creates a separate collaboration space
- Users with the same room ID can collaborate
- Room ID can be changed in the settings dropdown

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `yjs` - CRDT library for collaborative editing
- `y-prosemirror` - ProseMirror integration for Y.js
- `y-webrtc` - WebRTC provider for Y.js
- `simple-peer` - WebRTC peer-to-peer library
- `uuid` - Unique identifier generation

### Architecture
- **Frontend-only**: No backend required for testing
- **Peer-to-peer**: Direct connections between users
- **Real-time**: WebRTC and Y.js provide low-latency updates
- **Conflict-free**: CRDT ensures data consistency

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Open multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Navigate to the blog editor (`/blog/poster`)
3. Enable collaborative mode in both tabs
4. Use the same room ID
5. Start editing - changes should appear in real-time
6. Test voice chat by joining from both tabs

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with WebRTC support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Requires HTTPS for WebRTC (use localhost for development)

## Limitations

### Current Implementation
- Uses BroadcastChannel for signaling (same-origin only)
- Simplified Y.js integration (not full CRDT)
- Basic voice chat without advanced features
- No persistent storage

### Production Considerations
- Need proper signaling server for cross-origin collaboration
- Implement proper Y.js synchronization
- Add user authentication
- Implement persistent document storage
- Add advanced voice features (screen sharing, etc.)
