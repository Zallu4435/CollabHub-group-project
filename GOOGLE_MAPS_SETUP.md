# Google Maps Integration Setup

This project now includes real Google Maps integration for location selection. Follow these steps to set it up:

## 1. Get a Google Maps API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - **Maps JavaScript API**
   - **Geocoding API**
   - **Places API** (optional, for enhanced location search)

## 2. Create API Key

1. Go to "Credentials" in the Google Cloud Console
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
3. Copy your API key
4. (Optional) Restrict the API key to your domain for security

## 3. Set Environment Variable

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google Maps API key.

## 4. Features Included

### üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map**
- Real Google Maps with full controls
- Click anywhere on the map to select a location
- Draggable markers for precise positioning
- Street view, satellite, and terrain views

### üìç **Geocoding**
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Convert coordinates to readable addresses
- **Forward Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates
- Automatic address parsing (city, state, country)
- Fallback handling for failed geocoding requests

### üéØ **Location Selection Methods**
1. **Manual Input**: Type an address (automatically geocoded)
2. **Auto-Detect**: Use browser geolocation + reverse geocoding
3. **Map Selection**: Click or drag on the interactive map

### üîß **Technical Features**
- TypeScript support with proper Google Maps types
- Error handling and loading states
- Responsive design
- API key validation
- Graceful fallbacks

## 5. Usage

The location picker is automatically integrated into:
- Blog post creation form
- Blog post editing modal
- Location input component

Users can now:
- Click the "Map" button to open the interactive map
- Click anywhere on the map to select a location
- Drag the marker for precise positioning
- See real-time address information
- Use auto-detect for current location

## 6. API Costs

Google Maps API has usage-based pricing:
- **Maps JavaScript API**: $7 per 1,000 loads
- **Geocoding API**: $5 per 1,000 requests
- **Places API**: $17 per 1,000 requests

For development, Google provides $200 in free credits monthly.

## 7. Security Notes

- Never commit your API key to version control
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Consider restricting your API key to specific domains
- Monitor your API usage in the Google Cloud Console

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Map Not Loading
- Check if your API key is correctly set in `.env.local`
- Verify that the Maps JavaScript API is enabled
- Check browser console for error messages

### Geocoding Not Working
- Ensure the Geocoding API is enabled
- Check your API key permissions
- Verify you haven't exceeded quota limits

### TypeScript Errors
- Make sure `@types/google.maps` is installed
- Check that your Google Maps types are up to date

## 9. Development vs Production

### Development
- Use a development API key with minimal restrictions
- Enable all necessary APIs for testing

### Production
- Use a production API key with domain restrictions
- Monitor usage and set up billing alerts
- Consider implementing rate limiting

## 10. Alternative Setup (Without API Key)

If you don't want to set up Google Maps API, the component will show a helpful message asking for the API key. The rest of the blog functionality will work normally without the map feature.
